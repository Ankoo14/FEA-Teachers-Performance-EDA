## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Insights on factors affecting management performance

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Excel

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   https://github.com/Ankoo14/Teachers_Performance_Analysis_FEA.git
   
## Usage
- Open student_performance_analysis.ipynb (for Jupyter Notebook) or run student_performance_analysis.py (for script execution).
- Remeber to check the path of the dataset.
- Run the analysis and explore the generated visualizations.

## Results
- Correlation Analysis: Identified key features impacting teachers and zone performance.
- Visualization Insights: Graphs showing students attendance and enrolments and the staff, zone performance every week .
